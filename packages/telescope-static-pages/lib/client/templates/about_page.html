<h3>What is CodeBuddies.org?</h3>
<p>We're a community of people learning web development. Learning with others helps us learn faster. The project is free and open-sourced. </p>

<div id="faq-pay"></div>
<h3>Do I need to pay anything to join these communities?</h3>
<p>No. It's free and a safe space. We help each other out.</p>



<div id="faq-why"></div>
<h3>What's the inspiration behind CodeBuddies.org?</h3>
                <p> The number of resources available online for anyone who wants to learn web development on their own is vast, but it can be quite frustrating for a beginner the first time they set up a development environment, touch the command line, fix a merge conflict in git, miss a semicolon, or find that a section of a tutorial they were following is outdated.</p>
                <p>I know because I've experienced all of these hiccups first-hand.</p>
                <p>What I've discovered since I started learning is that <em>people</em> -- mentors, co-workers, and study partners -- were key to accelerating my learning. But not everyone has access to study partners or mentors/co-workers who can help them.</p>

<div id="faq-who"></div>
<h3>Who should join these learning communities?</h3>
<p>Anyone can join as long as you have an internet connection! You don't need to <em>be</em> or aspire to be a career programmer. Code literacy is for everyone.</p>

<div id="faq-adv"></div>
<h3>Why do I need study groups if I can just find the answer on Stackoverflow?</h3>
                <p>Accountability partners help you:
                <ol>
                    <li>Stay motivated enough to truly master the tutorial.</li>
                    <li>Get un-stuck faster, because other people know exactly what issue you're running into because they're working on the same tutorial. </li>
                    <li>Take advantage of a safe environment where you can ask questions you might hesitate to ask in a public forum.</li>
                    <li>Make connections and exchange helpful tips knowledge with peers who understand your background and skill level.</li>
                    <li>Validate your understanding of the material when you find yourself explaining concepts to others running into the same questions you once ran into. (The open-source community has a culture of being quite collaborative: get help, and helps others in turn!)</li>
                </ol>

<div id="faq-hangout-tips"></div>
<h3>How can Google Hangouts be used most effectively for learning HTML/CSS, Javascript, Python, etc.?</h3>
                <p>Some general hangout tips:
                <ol>
                    <li>You don't need to turn on video. Use audio to questions freely.</li>
                    <li>Share screens to keep yourself focused and to make it easier to follow your study partners' progress.  </li>
                    <li>To share your screen, clickicon on the left sidebar of the hangout, and then click on the first screen that appears inside the module. Your hangout partners would then be able to click on your icon to see your workflow, and then help you identify your problem much more easily. </li>
                    <li>Google Hangout lets all participants share their screens simultaneously.</li>
                    <li>Share helpful Stackoverflow links with each other in the chat window.</li>
                    <li> If you found the hangout productive, schedule the next time to meet so you can keep the productive momentum going.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>

<div id="faq-whose"></div>
<h3>Whose idea was this?</h3>
<p>Linda (<a href="http://bit.ly/1u7C0KQ">@lpnotes</a>) wanted to be a better web developer (and help others be better web developers too) and ended up with this website. </p>

<div id="faq-organizers"></div>
<h3>Who organizes the hangouts?</h3>
<p>Anyone can propose a hangout. </p>


<h3>What should I do when I join a hangout?</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Turn off your video camera</strong> to save on bandwidth. </li>
<li><strong>Screen share</strong> by <img src="//codebuddies.org/images/icon-screenshare.png"/> clicking on the green icon on the left (and the first window that appears after that). If everyone shares their screens, we can help each other more easily, see what we've each coded, and also be able to point out what we're talking about more easily.</li>
<li><strong>Take turns talking through new concepts and the code out loud.</strong> Give everyone a chance to speak and ask questions. A good number for an efficient study session, in fact, is between 2-5 people -- all working on the same exercises. </li>
</ol>

<h2>What are some general courtesy tips for hangout participants?</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Mute your microphone</strong> <img src="//codebuddies.org/images/icon-mute.png"/>  if loud background noise is coming from your environment.</li>
<li><strong>Do not feign surprise</strong> when someone doesnâ€™t know something. (Follow the <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/manual" target="_blank">Hacker School manual</a> for social rules.)</li>
</ol>
