		<h2>Important Hangout Tips</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Turn off your video camera</strong> to save on bandwidth. </li>
<li><strong>Screen share</strong> by <img src="//codebuddies.org/images/icon-screenshare.png"/> clicking on the green icon on the left (and the first window that appears after that). If everyone shares their screens, we can help each other more easily, see what we've each coded, and also be able to point out what we're talking about more easily.</li>
<li><strong>Take turns talking through new concepts and the code out loud.</strong> Give everyone a chance to speak and ask questions. A good number for an efficient study session, in fact, is between 2-5 people -- all working on the same exercises. </li>
</ol>

<h2>General Courtesy</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Mute your microphone</strong> <img src="//codebuddies.org/images/icon-mute.png"/>  if loud background noise is coming from your environment.</li>
<li><strong>Do not feign surprise</strong> when someone doesnâ€™t know something. (Follow the <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/manual" target="_blank">Hacker School manual</a> for social rules.)</li>
</ol>
