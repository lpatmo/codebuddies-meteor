###About
Project platform for [codebuddies.org](http://codebuddies.org). Forked from Telescope. Open-sourced.

The goal of this platform is to help users schedule google hangouts more easily to learn to code together.


###Open Issues
1. Ability to remove oneself from a group.
2. See the hangout link only if you join a group. (PENDING - not important)
3. Update the form with a "resources" URL.
4. Deploy using DigitalOcean/Compose.io
7. Figure out a way to mark posts as completed. (PENDING - not important)
8. (image)--<join group>--<checkmark yes when clicked> (not P1)
12. Add a class "active" to the menu tab label when the users is on that tab's page.
13. Prettify the hero blurb on the home page (add a background image, etc.)
14. Add a button that lets post the creator send a reminder e-mail to all the participants of a group.
15. Figure out a better notification system -- i.e. have some text on the post that says "next hangout meeting is at: ... "
16. Question: migrating the DB from meteor.com to compose.io -- is it possible?
17. Allow users to give award other karma points for being helpful during hangouts (OPTIONAL - not important)
18. Question: is it possible to allow an admin to add other "admins" for that post -- so that multiple people can edit a single post? Have to figure out logic.
19. Figure out how to move edits to post_page.html and post_page.js over into a package so that changes aren't overwritten.

###Closed Issues
9. Create static pages - "what can X let you do?" UPDATE: Created the /about page. (Linda)
10. Pull categories down so it's viewable on the jumbotron UPDATE: categories show up on the home page. (Linda)
11. Have the jumbotron appear only on the home page. (Linda)
5. Change the labels on the submit form. (Linda)
6. Get usernames users who "upvoted" a post and display it on a post page. (Linda, with some tips from Sacha)
