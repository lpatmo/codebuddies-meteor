###About
Project extension of codebuddies.org. Forked from Telescope. Open-sourced.

The goal of this platform is to help users schedule google hangouts more easily to learn to code together.


###Open Issues
1. Ability to remove oneself from a group.
2. See the hangout link only if you join a group.
3. Update the form with a "resources" URL.
4. Deploy using DigitalOcean/Compose.io
5. Change the labels on the submit form.
6. Get list of users who "upvoted" a post.
7. Figure out a way to mark posts as completed.
8. (image)--<join group>--<checkmark yes when clicked> (not P1)
9. Create static pages - "what can X let you do?"
10. Pull categories down so it's viewable on the jumbotron
